# PROJECT DESCRIPTION

This project works with a few methods used for arrays: some, every, find, findIndex.

some - look for at least an element in the array that meets a certain condition.
every - checks if every element in the array meets a condition
find - returns first element that meets a condition
findIndex - return the index of an element (first one) that meets a condition

# WHAT I LEARNED

I already worked with all these methods. I was not very familiar with splice method used to delete an element from array. First argument in slice is the index to start, second is the index to end;if the second argument is missing then we extract from index start to end of the array.
