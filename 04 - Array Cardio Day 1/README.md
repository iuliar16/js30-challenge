# PROJECT DESCRIPTION

This project uses array functions to sort, filter or extract some data from arrays. Functions used - 
sort - for sorting an array based on specific condition
filter - to get some specific data from array that meets a condition
map - to create a new array with data from initial array by applying a function to each element
reduce - returns a calculated value (like sum of some data in array or count something in array)

# WHAT I LEARNED

I already worked with these functions, although it was new to me how we created a new object in reduce (last example). I think I only used reduce until now to calculate a number like the example where we need the number of years the inventors live all together, but in the last example we need multiple numbers and it is a good idea to create an object for that.
